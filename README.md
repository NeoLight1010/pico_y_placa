# Pico y placa prediction for Ecuatorian Cars
The script determines whether or not a car can be on the road based on its license plate, day, and time. 

## Usage
Run the script from your terminal using your **python 3** interpreter like this:

```python
python3 main.py
```

## Input format
The script will ask you the following inputs:

* **Date:** you must insert it using this format DD-MM-YYYY, for example: 05-09-2020.
* **Plate:** Use the common plate format on Ecuador, 7 digits and the last 4 as numbers like this: AAA0123
* **Time:** this input must be in this format HH:MM, for example (20:45)

## Testing
I've included a script for unit testing, with some test already made, feel free to set your own.
